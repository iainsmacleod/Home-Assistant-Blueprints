# Motion-activated Light with Conditions and Optional Settings

## Overview

This Home Assistant blueprint automates lighting based on motion detection. It allows for optional customization of brightness and color settings and includes optional conditions based on a entity state and sun position. This makes it ideal for automating lights in your home with flexibility and precision.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Activates lights when motion is detected.
- **Customizable Lighting**: Optional settings for brightness and color.
- **Conditional Activation**: 
  - Based on the state of a specified entity.
  - Sun position (day or night).

  - **Name**: Sun Condition
  - **Description**: Select the sun condition to check (none represents always.
  - **Options**: none, day, night

## Conditions

1. **Entity State Condition**
   - This condition checks if a specified entity (such as an input_select representing house modes like morning, evening, or goodnight) is in one of the allowed states.

2. **Sun Position Condition**
   - The automation can be conditioned to only run during certain sun positionsâ€”specifically during the day or night, setting none means this condition is ignored and always run.

## Usage Instructions

1. Import this blueprint into your Home Assistant instance.
2. Configure the inputs according to your setup:
   - Select your motion sensors and lights.
   - Adjust wait time, brightness, and color settings as needed.
   - Optionally set a condition entity and allowed states if you want to restrict operation based on another entity's state.
   - Choose a sun condition if you want to restrict operation based on the time of day.

3. Save and activate the automation. The lights will turn on when motion is detected, subject to any conditions you've set.

## Notes

- Ensure that your motion sensors are properly configured in Home Assistant before using this blueprint.
- The sun condition requires that your Home Assistant instance has access to accurate sunrise/sunset times, via the sun entity.
